# 🎯 Chess Piece Scaling & Positioning Guide

## 🚀 Quick Fix for "Pieces Too Large/Close" Issue

The chess pieces are now **fully configurable** for size and positioning! No more giant pieces crowding the board.

## 🔧 New Settings (In Board Component Inspector)

### **Piece Positioning & Scale Section:**

1. **Piece Scale** (0.1 - 2.0)
   - **Default: 0.7** (30% smaller than original)
   - Smaller values = smaller pieces
   - Larger values = bigger pieces

2. **Piece Height Offset**
   - **Default: 0.5** (half a unit above board)
   - How high pieces float above tiles

3. **Center Pieces On Tiles**
   - **Default: True** (recommended)
   - Centers pieces perfectly on each square
   - False = pieces at tile corners (old behavior)

## 🎮 How to Adjust Piece Size

### **Method 1: In Unity Editor (Recommended)**
1. Select the **Board** object in your scene
2. In Inspector, find **"Piece Positioning & Scale"**
3. Adjust **Piece Scale** slider:
   - `0.5` = Half size (small, clean look)
   - `0.7` = Default (balanced)
   - `1.0` = Original asset size
   - `1.5` = Larger pieces

### **Method 2: Runtime Updates**
1. Right-click the **Board** component in Inspector
2. Choose **"Update All Piece Positions and Scale"**
3. All existing pieces instantly update!

## 🎯 Recommended Settings
