   ```

3. **Integration with Our Chess3D Code:**
   - Our code is already designed to support both primitives and prefabs
   - Update ChessGameSetup.cs to assign the new prefabs
   - Maintain fallback to primitives if prefabs aren't assigned

### Code Integration Plan

#### Phase 1: Add Prefab Support to ChessGameSetup
- Add public fields for piece prefabs
- Update CreatePieceAtPosition to use prefabs when available
- Maintain primitive fallback for rapid prototyping

#### Phase 2: Material System Upgrade  
- Use asset's included materials
- Add proper white/black material assignment
- Implement piece selection highlighting

#### Phase 3: Board Integration
- Integrate the chess board model
- Align piece positions with board squares
- Update tile generation to match board layout

### Benefits of This Asset
- **Professional Quality:** High-detail models vs primitive cubes
- **Performance Optimized:** Reasonable triangle counts for real-time games
- **Complete Set:** All pieces + board included
- **Source Files:** Blender files for customization
- **Free License:** No additional costs

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Gradual Migration:** Keep primitives as fallback during development
2. **Configurable System:** Allow switching between primitives and models
3. **Testing First:** Verify all game logic works with new models
4. **Visual Polish:** Add materials, lighting, and selection feedback

This asset will transform our functional chess game into a visually appealing experience while maintaining all the solid game logic we've built.
