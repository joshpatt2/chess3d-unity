# ðŸŽ¯ QUICK START: Adding Chess Pieces & Board Asset

## Step 1: Get the Asset (FREE)
1. Open Unity with your chess project
2. Go to **Window > Asset Store**
3. Search for **"Chess Pieces & Board"** (ID: 70092)
4. Click **"Add to My Assets"** (it's free!)
5. Click **"Import"** and import all files

## Step 2: Auto-Assign to Your Chess Game
1. In Unity, go to **Tools > Chess3D > Auto-Assign Asset Store Pieces**
2. The script will automatically find and assign all chess piece models
3. You'll see a success message with how many pieces were assigned

## Step 3: Test Your Upgraded Chess Game
1. Press **Play** in Unity
2. Your chess game now uses beautiful 3D models instead of cubes!
3. All game logic remains exactly the same

## Alternative: Manual Assignment
If auto-assignment doesn't work:
1. Find your **ChessSetupManager** in the scene
2. In the Inspector, expand **"3D Asset Integration"**
3. Drag each piece model from the Project window to the corresponding field:
   - **Pawn Prefab** â†’ `Assets/ChessPieces&Board/Models/Pieces/Pawn.fbx`
   - **Rook Prefab** â†’ `Assets/ChessPieces&Board/Models/Pieces/Rook.fbx`
   - **Knight Prefab** â†’ `Assets/ChessPieces&Board/Models/Pieces/Knight.fbx`
   - **Bishop Prefab** â†’ `Assets/ChessPieces&Board/Models/Pieces/Bishop.fbx`
   - **Queen Prefab** â†’ `Assets/ChessPieces&Board/Models/Pieces/Queen.fbx`
   - **King Prefab** â†’ `Assets/ChessPieces&Board/Models/Pieces/King.fbx`

## Fallback System
- **No assets assigned?** Game uses primitive cubes (still fully functional)
- **Some assets missing?** Uses 3D models for found pieces, primitives for others
- **Want to switch back?** Use **Tools > Chess3D > Clear All Asset Assignments**

## What You Get
- **Professional 3D Models:** High-quality chess pieces (2K-4K triangles each)
- **Same Gameplay:** All chess rules, castling, check/checkmate work identically
- **Better Visuals:** Recognizable piece shapes instead of cubes
- **Performance:** Optimized models suitable for real-time games

## Next Steps
- Fine-tune piece positioning if needed
- Add custom materials for piece colors
- Consider using the included chess board model
- Add piece selection highlighting effects

**Your chess game just got a major visual upgrade! ðŸŽ‰**
